    about
</h5>
<p>
    Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.<br>
Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.<br>
Designers are toolmakers.<br>
Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.<br>
Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.<br>
Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.<br>
